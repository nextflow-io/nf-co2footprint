Total CO₂e footprint measures of this workflow run (including cached tasks):
  CO₂e emissions: 6.73 g
  Energy consumption: 14.02 Wh
  CO₂e emissions (market): -

Which equals:
  - 0.038 km travelled by car
  - It takes one tree 5h 21min 43.83s to sequester the equivalent amount of CO₂ from the atmosphere
  - 0.013 % of a flight from Paris to London

The calculation of these values is based on the carbon footprint computation method developed in the Green Algorithms project:
