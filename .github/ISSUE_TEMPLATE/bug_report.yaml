        When I tried to run `fetch banana --amount 3`, I noticed that the **bananas** I got were still very much green (see *image_1.png*), indicating that they should not be eaten.

        What are steps for us to see what problem you are facing? In an ideal world you would provide a minimal example. You may also attach example data if necessary.
      placeholder: |
        1. Install `banana-tree` via `planting`
        2. Run `fetch banana --amount 1` (produces same result)
        3. Inspect the color (my banana was close to \#51a03d)
